Reshaped Dutch municipaliteis (GADM)

This script reshapes the original spatialpolygondataframe file from http://www.gadm.org.
It contains the geographic boundaries of Dutch municipalities.
The original file was outdated due to recent municipal redivisions (gemmeentelijke herindelingen).
The script merges several old municipalitie into new ones, including the new names given.
I have also included the output of the file in case the original file at gadm.org is changed.
The file present the situation as of 1 January 2016.
